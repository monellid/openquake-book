The calculation of stochastic event sets \index{Stochastic event set} and the corresponding ground motion fields is a methodology tightly connected with a specific seismic risk analysis of common use within the insurance and re-insurance industry (CITATION). 

OpenQuake - given a Source System - can generate a number of seismicity histories, each one representing a possible realisation of the seismicity that the sources included in a Source Model can generate within a given time span (fixed by the user).

The 

Each rupture in a seismicity history is successively associated with a ground motion field, an object describing the spatial distribution of a scalar parameter representative of the intensity of shaking (e.g. PGA or Spectral Acceleration). OpenQuake has the capability to generate

\section{Stochastic Event Set Calculator}
OpenQuake generates Stochastic Event Sets using the Inverse Trasform Sampling technique, probably the simplest and commonest methodology used to randomly sample probabily distribution starting from its cumulative form.

\subsection{Spatially correlated ground motion fields}
The generation of spatially correlated ground motion fields is based on the work of \citet{jayaram2009} where they propose a model - based on a semivarigram - for describing 
\begin{equation}
\gamma(h) = a \left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{3h}{b}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

\section{Stochastic PSHA calculator} 
The OpeQuake stochastic PSHA calculator provides a way to check the consistency between the result provided by a classical PSHA calculator and the results that can be obtained by a number of ground motion fields, representative of the
